## Projects

### 1. **CircuitBreakerService**
   A demonstration of the Circuit Breaker pattern using Resilience4j to handle faults in microservices architecture and ensure system stability under failure conditions.

### 2. **FirstRest** & **FirstRest-1**
   Basic Spring Boot applications implementing RESTful web services with CRUD operations, providing an introduction to REST principles and handling HTTP requests.

### 3. **JpaManyToMany**
   Example project showing the use of JPA (Java Persistence API) with a Many-to-Many relationship between entities, focusing on relational database management.

### 4. **JpaMysql**
   A project that integrates JPA with MySQL, showing how to perform database operations like CRUD in a MySQL database using JPA.

### 5. **KafkaConsumer** & **KafkaProducer**
   These projects demonstrate the implementation of Apache Kafka to create producer and consumer services for handling messaging and real-time streaming data.

### 6. **LoadBalancer**
   An example of using Spring Cloud Load Balancer for distributing client requests across multiple instances of microservices, ensuring load distribution and fault tolerance.

### 7. **MySQLException**
   A project designed to handle exceptions during MySQL database interactions using Spring Boot, demonstrating robust error handling mechanisms.

### 8. **OAuth**
   A Spring Boot project that integrates OAuth for secure authentication and authorization, exploring third-party login and secure API access.

### 9. **OpenFeign**
   Demonstrates the use of Spring Cloud OpenFeign for creating declarative REST clients in microservices, simplifying service-to-service communication.

### 10. **RabbitMQ**
   A project that shows how to use RabbitMQ as a messaging broker for asynchronous communication between microservices using message queues.

### 11. **Relationships**
   A project exploring different types of entity relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) using JPA and Hibernate for relational database mapping.

### 12. **SerializationDemo**
   A project demonstrating object serialization and deserialization in Java, exploring how to convert objects to streams for storage and transmission.

### 13. **Sleuth**
   This project demonstrates distributed tracing using Spring Cloud Sleuth, providing insights into how requests flow through microservices for better observability.

### 14. **SpringSecurity**
   A comprehensive project demonstrating security principles in Spring Boot using Spring Security, including authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 15. **config-client** & **config-server**
   Demonstrates the use of Spring Cloud Config Server and Client for managing distributed configurations across microservices, ensuring consistency and easy configuration management.

### 16. **eurekaservice**
   A project showcasing the use of Eureka Server for service discovery in microservices architecture, enabling dynamic scaling and communication between services.

### 17. **spring-oauth2-google**
   A project that integrates Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, demonstrating secure third-party login for web applications.

### 18. **store-application**
   A web application that simulates a store, showcasing Spring Boot's integration with databases and RESTful services to manage products, customers, and orders.

### 19. **firstRestJpaH2** & **firstRestJpaMysql**
   Projects combining RESTful services with JPA, using H2 in-memory database and MySQL, respectively, to demonstrate database operations in a Spring Boot application.

### 20. **greetLocal**
   A simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates local greeting services, providing a basic introduction to building Spring Boot REST APIs.

### 21. **hello-service-resilience4j**
   Demonstrates the usage of Resilience4j in a microservice to implement fault tolerance patterns like Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Rate Limiting.

### 22. **hello-server**
   Implements a Eureka Server for service discovery, which allows different microservices to register and discover each other for dynamic scaling and efficient communication in microservices architecture.

### 23. **hellogateway**
   Demonstrates the use of Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and filtering requests to backend microservices, handling cross-cutting concerns like security and monitoring.

### 24. **helloClient**
   A client application designed to consume services from a server, demonstrating REST client principles using Spring Boot.

### 25. **javaCore**
   A collection of core Java concepts and examples, covering OOP principles, data structures, exception handling, and more.
